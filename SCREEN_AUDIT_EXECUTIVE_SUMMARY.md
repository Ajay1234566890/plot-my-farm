## 🚀 My Recommendation

### Option 1: Test Now (RECOMMENDED) ✅
1. Start testing 12 complete screens immediately
2. I implement Phase 5 & 6 in parallel
3. You report bugs while I work
4. We iterate and fix issues
5. Full app ready in 6-8 hours

**Advantage**: Parallel work, faster overall

### Option 2: Wait for All Screens
1. Wait for Phase 5 (2-3 hours)
2. Wait for Phase 6 (4-5 hours)
3. Test all 47 screens
4. Report bugs
5. Fix bugs

**Advantage**: Complete testing, but slower
